# DreamFactory
You play the role of a new employee inside the Dream Factory, wherein a mysterious race of beings works day in and day out to design the dreams of humans. Your job is to fix the machines within the factory, but not everything is as it seems...

Chalk full of humorous moments and colorful characters, come enter the world of your dreams! (or more specifically, someone else's)

All assets, including art, music, SFX and code have been created for the purpose of this jam.

### Controls:
AWSD for movement
Spacebar for action (dialogue requires the mouse)
Escape for the pause menu

Known issues (fixes are being worked on and will be updated as soon as we can):
- Finishing combat with a damage spell can sometimes cause the game to cease further action and require a restart
- Returning to the main menu doesn't allow the player to perform any actions after and will require a restart
- Some objects missing collision parameters
- Dialogue names switch (ex. Sal labeled as Fred)
